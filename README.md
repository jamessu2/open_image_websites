# open_image_websites

As a [blog](https://askmeabetterquestion.com/) writer, whenever I finish writing a post, the last step is always to search for some images / pictures â€“ i.e. make the post look better.

And this ALWAYS involves going to my browser, typing in the same-old URLs to royalty-free image websites (across multiple tabs), and searching for a particular term / phrase on each site.

A perfect task to automate.



## Install/Setup 

```bash
git clone "https://github.com/jamessu2/open_image_websites.git"
cd open_image_websites
pip install -r requirements.txt
source open_image_websites.sh
```

**Note #1**: You need to change the directory path in *open_image_websites.sh* to your own directory path.

**Note #2**: You need to install the *"Latest stable release"* version of [chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/), and add it to `$PATH`.

**Note #3**: The `source open_image_websites.sh` command only works if you're in the *open_image_websites* directory. Also, it only sets `search` as a Terminal command for the current Terminal session. (You'd need to rerun on every new Terminal session.)

	To have the `search` command persist, add the *open_image_websites* directory to `$PATH`, as well as the `source open_image_websites.sh` command to *.bash_profile* / *.bashrc* (probably located in your ~ directory).



## Usage

To run the script, type in `search <term>`



## Functionality
Script will open up these websites:

- https://www.upsplash.com
- https://www.pixabay.com
- https://stocksnap.io
- https://burst.shopify.com
- https://www.gratisography.com

and autosearch each site for the desired term/phrase, then terminate. 

(Super easy to add / remove image sites to search.)


## Future Developments
*1st stage: completed Dec 4th, 2019.*

Next-level functionality:

1. Allow the user to re-search all the sites for a new term / phrase. Don't terminate until the user **quits**.

	(i.e. need to run more searches)

2. Figure out how to autosearch these sites:
	- https://www.pexels.com
	- https://www.reshot.com
	
	Trying to retrieve their input boxes gives an *"Element not interactable"* error message.
	
	Tried Python's `find_element_by_css_selector` instead of `find_elements_by_xpath`, to no avail.
